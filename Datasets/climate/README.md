# Climate Datasets

## GHG Datasets
### [Climate TRACE Emissions Inventory](https://www.climatetrace.org/inventory)
#### Comprehensive accounting of gloabl ghg emissions based on direct, independent observation
Emissions broken down by country, sector, subsector, year (since 2015)
#

### [Gridemissions: Tracking Emissions in the US electricity system](https://github.com/jdechalendar/gridemissions/)
#### API & Visualization resource for understanding recent emissions in US electricity

#
### [Climatiq](https://www.climatiq.io/)
#### API for measuring Carbon Emissions when & where they happen.

#
### [Monoa Loa CO2 dataset (& other atmospheric measures)](https://gml.noaa.gov/dv/data/index.php?site=MLO)
#### The infamous dataset showing rising CO2 from 1969 - present
Can also inspect other atmospheric measures & other monitoring stations (ie. different sites)
