# **climate-energy-data**

## Climate, Environmental, &amp; Energy Data for students in the UC Berkeley School of Information (and any others!)

### [Datasets](https://github.com/caseymcgon/climate-energy-data/tree/main/Datasets)
#### Look here for collections of climate-related datasets:
 - [**climate**](https://github.com/caseymcgon/climate-energy-data/tree/main/Datasets/climate) (generally: temperature & ghg emissions data)
 - [**energy**](https://github.com/caseymcgon/climate-energy-data/tree/main/Datasets/energy) (generally: energy generation & storage data)
 - [**environment**](https://github.com/caseymcgon/climate-energy-data/tree/main/Datasets/environment) (generally: land, freshwater, ocean, & organics data)

please note: there is some crossover (ie. tracking water temp & currents in the ocean could be climate or environment), so look in the other directories if you can't find your exact data)
