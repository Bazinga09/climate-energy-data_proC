## Climate, Environmental, &amp; Energy Data for students in the UC Berkeley School of Information (and any others!)

### Datasets
#### Look here for collections of climate-related datasets:
 - climate (generally: temperature & ghg emissions data)
 - energy (generally: energy generation & storage data)
 - environment (generally: land, freshwater, ocean, & organics data)

please note: there is some crossover (ie. tracking water temp & currents in the ocean could be climate or environment), so look in the other directories if you can't find your exact data)
 
### Projects
#### Look here for collections of climate-related projects:
 - past-projects
